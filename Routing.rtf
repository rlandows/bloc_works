\f0\fs24 \cf0 Our routing grabs the url and is able to get us the controller we want. For instance, if we type in /books/welcome, our routing splits up the url, ignoring the content to the left of the first /. Then it takes the books and through various methods makes it into BooksController. We then take the welcome and call the welcome method from the BooksController class. The method then renders the view of the welcome page. Rails has resourceful routing which allows routes to be declared in a single line of code. It appears that there are several ways to route in rails, while our application at the moment has just one way of routing. }
